        <h1>Standard Model</h1>
        <p>    
            Quarks, leptons and gauge bosons are considered as the most elementary particles
            observed in laboratories. Due to color confinement, only color singlet configurations
            of quarks are observed in nature. Mesons and baryons are well known color singlet
            structures. Further Gell-Mann and Zweig gave the idea of color singlet hadronic state
            with qq<span style="text-decoration: overline;">qq</span> and qqqq<span style="text-decoration: overline;">q</span> 
            quark combinations known as tetraquarks and pentaquarks.
            After the discovery of J/Î¨ in 1974, heavy quarkonium studies have also become very important in hadron physics and further studies
            are needed to determine the properties of such hadrons. Various tools such as the bag model, QCD sum rules, Bethe-Salpeter equation method,
            various phenomenological potential models, and lattice QCD (LQCD) are being used in this endeavour[1]. Our group focuses on the QCDSR Method for the 
            most part.
