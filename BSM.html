        <h1>Beyond Standard Model</h1>
        <p>    
            The Standard Model is a very successful theoretical framework.
             It has allowed verification and prediction of multiple phenomenom that are observed with experimentally. 
             However, it does not account for every observed phenomenom, which derives in a need to look Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).
              Theories BSM attemp to answer question for which we don't have an answer within the Standard Model. 
              Matter-antimatter asymetry, neutrino mass, dark matter and dark energy, quantum theory of gravity, origins of masses and mixes, CP and heiarchy problems 
              are some of the main areas of research in BSM physics. In our collaboration, we investigate potential BSM composite particles and their properties.
